Running the demo
=================
Open the following programs:
- Legends of Runeterra (https://playruneterra.com)
- OBS Studio (https://obsproject.com/) with OBS Websocket 5 (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket - in beta at time of writing, will be preinstalled soon)

Write the configuration for OBS Websocket in the following format:

<?php
const OBS_URL = "ws://127.0.0.1:4444";
const OBS_PASSWORD = "(obs websocket password)";

You can find this information in Tools > obs-websocket Settings

Install the project with composer install and run the file run.php with PHP (see composer.json for required PHP version and extensions).

In OBS, create a scene with two sources:
- Scene source (_obs)
- Game Capture (set to capture Legends of Runeterra executable)

Text will be shown on the Scene source corresponding to the current game state.

Also included in the repository, but not fully functional in the demo, are:
- A data reader for Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story (suffers from crashes, requires running my fork of melonDS - https://github.com/iggyvolz/melonDS/tree/rpc)
- An object-oriented interface for scenes (easier to demonstrate using procedural programming)
- A Lua binding to PHP, and a Lua library for reading data from data readers and writing to OBS (suffers from unexplained Lua stack crashes)
